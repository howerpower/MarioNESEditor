This tool has been adapted from another Nes CHR editor located here, https://github.com/JimMarshall35/nes-sprite-editor
Use that tool if you are looking for sprite editor for games other than Super Mario Bros.

This browser tool allows to upload a copy of Super Mario Bros, extract and edit the graphics and repack it back into a rom to be downloaded.

This is all done client side.
